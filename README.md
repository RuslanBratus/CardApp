My own online store app with own design and options:
-Online products (with using Firebase Realtime Database)
-Authentication (email&password with Firebase)
-Opportunity to add a bank card to profile (With card checking)
-Opportunity to buy a product (but without payment operations, it wasn't added)
-Saved purchases history for user
